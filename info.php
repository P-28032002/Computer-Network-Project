    <br><br><b><h3>Router: </h3></b><h4>A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. 
        Routers perform the traffic directing functions on the Internet. Data sent through the internet, such as a web page or email, 
        is in the form of data packets. </h4><br>
    <b><h3>Switch: </h3></b><h4>Switches are networking devices operating at layer 2 or a data link layer of the OSI model. 
        They connect devices in a network and use packet switching to send, 
        receive or forward data packets or data frames over the network</h4><br>
    <b><h3>Server: </h3></b><h4>A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, 
        known as clients, over a network. In theory, 
        whenever computers share resources with client machines they are considered servers.</h4><br>
    <b><h3>SMTP: </h3></b><h4>SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. SMTP is a set of communication guidelines that allow software to 
        transmit an electronic mail over the internet is called Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. 
        It is a program used for sending messages to other computer users based on e-mail addresses.</h4><br>
    <b><h3>Web-Based Email: </h3></b><h4>This allows users to log into the email server through the use of an Internet browser to send and receive their mail.
       It is useful for people on the go since they can check their email anywhere they have access to the Internet.</h4><br>
    <b><h3>POP3 Email Servers: </h3></b><h4>Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3) is another common type of email server, often used by ISPs that provide users with email 
      accounts along with Internet service. POP3 servers will store incoming email messages on a remote server until a user opens an email client software to check her mail. 
      The messages will be retrieved from the server, transferred to the user's computer and deleted off the server to make space for more incoming messages.</h4><br>
    <b><h3>IMAP Email Servers: </h3></b><h4>Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is an alternate to the POP3 email server, often used by business email accounts. 
      The benefit of IMAP is that it allows users to preview, delete and organize emails before they transfer them from the email server to their computers. 
      The IMAP server will leave copies of the email on the server until the user decides it is time to delete them.</h4><br>
